class JobBase(object):
    """Base class for all actual Jobs.

    All actual Jobs will take a (possibly empty) dictionary of parameters that
    it will parse and apply to its calculation.

    args:
        params - key value pairs for the params that the job will run using

    To run a Job we invoke the runjob() method which decides how to call
    the following methods:
        - _setup(): Responsible for constructing the arguments for the command
            line tool being invoked and doing any other prep work such as
            compilation.

        _set_output_dirs(): Set the attribute self.job_output_dirs with list of
            local or s3 directories for output files. These directories will be
            deleted when the job fails if _CLEANUP_AFTER_FAILURE is set to True.

        _execute(): Responsible for running the executable with the parameters
            that were setup(). Some jobs will have more complex execute methods,
            e.g. running the executable once for each day.

            This method should raise an exception if the job could not execute
            successfully.

            If this job produced any output that needs to be persisted or
            post-processed, the _execute function is also responsible for
            assigning that data to the "self._job_output" variable. The output
            is expected to be in list-of-lists format, which can roughly be
            translated into row-column format:
            self._job_output = [
                ['cell1a', 'cell1b'], # row 1
                ['cell2a', 'cell2b'], # row 2
            ]

            The _execute function is also responsible for assigning the
            "self._job_stderr" variable which takes the same format of data as
            _job_output.

        _complete(): Responsible for persisting any of the query results.
            For example, the _REPORTER is invoked in the _complete method.

        _cleanup(): Cleans up any temporary local files, or temporary S3/HDFS
            files. This will be called even if the other methods raise
            exceptions.
