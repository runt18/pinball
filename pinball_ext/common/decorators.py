    original from: http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Retry

    Args:
        ExceptionToCheck: exception to check. May be a tuple of
            exceptions to check.
        tries: an integer, number of times to try (not retry) before
            giving up.
        delay: an integer, initial delay between retries in seconds.
        backoff: an integer, backoff multiplier e.g. value of 2 will
            double the delay each retry
        logger: logging.Logger instance, logger to use. By default,
            we use ``logging.Logger.log``; if None is explicitly specified by
            the caller, ``print`` is used.
        sleep_func: the sleep function to be used for waiting between
            retries. By default, it is ``time.sleep``,
            but it could also be gevent.sleep if we are using this with
            gevent.
        max_delay: the max number of seconds to wait between retries.

    Returns:
        Decorator function.
