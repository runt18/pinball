"""Definition of a token used to generate unique version values.

Blessed version is stored in the master as any other token.  Each time a new
version number is needed, it is generated off the value stored in that token.
The value stored in blessed version is a monotonically increasing counter
so it is guaranteed that no single value is issued more than once.
