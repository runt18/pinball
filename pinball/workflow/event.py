"""Event signals system state change.

Events are posted to job inputs.  Job input is a bucket for tokens representing
a class of events (e.g., completion of a specific upstream job).  A job becomes
runnable if it has at least one event in each input.  We call a group of
events with one token in each job input 'triggering' events.  Triggering events
get consumed (i.e., removed from the master) when the job becomes runnable.
